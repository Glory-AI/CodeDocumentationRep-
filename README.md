One of the biggest lessons I’m learning from tackling LeetCode problems is that problem analysis comes before syntax.
For example, in the Longest Common Prefix problem, I didn’t rush to code immediately. Instead, I broke it down like this:
* There has to be a reference word that all others are compared to.

* Using a loop, each letter in the reference is matched with the corresponding letter in the other words.

* As long as the characters match, the index keeps increasing.

* The moment a mismatch is found, the loop stops, and the common part so far becomes the prefix.

By thinking this way, I realized the solution was less about writing clever syntax and more about understanding where the problem naturally stops.
This approach is helping me strengthen my analytical ability.
