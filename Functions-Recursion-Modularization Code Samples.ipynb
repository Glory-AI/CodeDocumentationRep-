    "Functions can be a very great tool in the life of a programmer. They help keep our code understandable and reusable. It is convenient and essential for programmers to be able to build, tweak, and use their functions as though they were built-in features of the programming language.\n",

    "It is often convenient to split functions into multiple smaller ones. This:\n",

    "It must have at least one base case to stop the recursion.\n",
