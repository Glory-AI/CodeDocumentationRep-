        "Sorting and searching? Sounds basic, right? But the truth is — they’re powerful tools in programming, especially when you're dealing with real-world engineering problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "So here’s the idea I had today 💡:\n",
        "Imagine running an experiment where you try different voltage inputs and record the current output. You end up with a bunch of voltage-current pairs stored in a dictionary — scattered and unordered 😅\n",
        "\n",
        "Now an engineer comes along needing to find the exact voltage that gives a specific current for their design. How do we help them?\n",
        "\n",
        "That’s where sorting and searching come in — to bring order and speed!\n",
        "\n",
        "I implemented both linear search (the straightforward, look-through-everything method) and binary search (the smart, divide-and-conquer method). But before the searching magic happens, the data is sorted — because, let’s be real, binary search doesn’t work on chaos  \n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Sorting organizes the current values\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Binary search finds the closest match in record time\n",
        "🔹 Linear search gives us a baseline to compare\n",
        "\n",
        "This isn’t just about getting results — it’s about writing efficient programs that scale well, especially when you’re working with large sets of experimental data.\n",
